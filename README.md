### Description

This paper aims to reduce the wasted effort finding the proper size of the latent space in designing an autoencoder, by estimating in advance the intrinsic dimension of a dataset. The estimation process was inspired by how human interpolates discontinuous set of points and imagine a continuous analogue in his/her mind. This approach is in contrast with the traditional approaches, which assume the existence of some continuous manifold first and try to guess its dimension given a finite sample from the infinite set.
