### Description

This paper aims to reduce the wasted effort finding the proper size of the latent space in designing an autoencoder, by estimating in advance the intrinsic dimension of a dataset. The estimation process was inspired by how human interpolates discontinuous set of points and imagine a continuous analogue in his/her mind. This is in contrast to the traditional approaches, which first assume the existence of some continuous manifold, seeing the dataset at hand as a finite sample from the infinite set, and try to guess the dimension of the manifold by examining various statistical properties of the sample.
